#
# The IPSW images are raw APFS with LZBITMAP-compressed files: they are read
# through apfs-fuse (decompressing), so the HFS+ copy is uncompressed. On a
# device /private/preboot is its own volume holding the cryptexes, which
# /System/Cryptexes/{OS,App} link to; here they live inside the one volume.
# Owners, modes, symlinks and hard links are preserved (rsync -aH as root).
#
# The volume is journaled (XNU replays the journal after a panic; Linux only
# mounts it read-write with -o force and leaves the journal empty). NABU
# additions: /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld hard-links the SystemOS
# cryptex shared cache (ignition_level=1 looks there), and
# /private/var/keybags/systembag.kb is the plain-plist system keybag that
# keybagd reads with /defaults/no-effaceable-storage (tools/mkadt.py).

# denied", xpcproxy exit 78) and backboardd never starts.  Their image v9 had
